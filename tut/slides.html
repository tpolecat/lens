# 15 Minutes of Lens
Rob Norris • `@tpolecat` • Gemini Observatory

???

- Ok so I'm going to talk about lenses **just a little bit**.
- They're a really cool abstraction for querying and updating immutable data structures, which is something that seems really awkward if you're first learning how to work with immutable data.

---

# Goals
- Understand why `Lens` is a useful abstraction.
- Understand a simple implementation.
- Understand lens composition.

# Non-Goals
- Understand `State` monad examples.
- Understand "modern" lenses.

---

# Immutable Data

A data type with nested structure.

```tut:silent
case class Person(first: String, last: String)
case class Band(name: String, lead: Person)
case class Album(name: String, band: Band)

val a = 
  Album("Dark Side of the Spoon", 
    Band("Green Floyd", 
      Person("Steve",  "Gilmour")
    )
  )
```

???

- ok so we have an instance with some typos that we want to fix. So how do we do that?

---

# Updating with `copy`

Scala provides `copy` but it is awkward the deeper you go.

```tut
a
val b = a.copy(name = "Dark Side of the Moon")
val c = b.copy(band = b.band.copy(name = "Pink Floyd"))
val d = c.copy(band = c.band.copy(lead = c.band.lead.copy(first = "David")))
```

???

- so you can see that this is irritating

---

# Our First Lens

Observation: querying and setting are a pair of functions.

```tut:silent
case class Lens[A,B](set: (A, B) => A, get: A => B)
```

Create one.

```tut:silent
val albumName = Lens[Album, String]((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
```

Try it!

```tut
albumName.get(a)
albumName.set(a, "Dark Side of the Moon")
```

???

- Ok this works but so what? It's more typing than just using `copy`.


---

# Our Second Lens

Observation: If we have a `Lens[A,B]` and a `Lens[B,C]` we can make a `Lens[A,C]`.

```tut:silent
  case class Lens[A,B](set: (A, B) => A, get: A => B) { outer =>

    def andThen[C](lens: Lens[B, C]): Lens[A, C] = {

      val set: (A, C) => A = { (a, c) => 
        val b1 = outer.get(a)    // get the b
        val b2 = lens.set(b1, c) // new b with updated c
        outer.set(a, b2)         // new a with updated b
      }

      val get: A => C = { a =>
        lens.get(outer.get(a))   // get is easier
      }

      Lens(set, get)

    }

  }
```

???

- ... so that means ...
- So if you didn't follow that I'm confident that you can follow it if you sit down with it later. There aren't that many ways to write it that compile.
- Ok so we can clean that up by inlining the implementations and it looks like this.

---

# Our Second Lens

Observation: If we have a `Lens[A,B]` and a `Lens[B,C]` we can make a `Lens[A,C]`.

```tut:silent
  case class Lens[A,B](set: (A, B) => A, get: A => B) {
    def andThen[C](lens: Lens[B, C]): Lens[A, C] =
      Lens((a, c) => set(a, lens.set(get(a), c)), a => lens.get(get(a)))
  }
```

Two lenses now.

```tut:silent
val albumBand = Lens[Album, Band  ]((a, b) => a.copy(band = b), _.band)
val bandName  = Lens[Band,  String]((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
```

Compose them!

```tut
val composed = albumBand andThen bandName
composed.get(a)
composed.set(a, "Dread Zeppelin")
```

???

- AAH! Ok now we're getting somewhere. We have a way of peeking down deep into a structure now.
- Let's do more.

---

# Our Second Lens

Two more lenses.

```tut:silent
val bandLead    = Lens[Band,   Person]((a, b) => a.copy(lead  = b), _.lead)
val personFirst = Lens[Person, String]((a, b) => a.copy(first = b), _.first)
```

Compose more!

```tut
val wayDown = albumBand andThen bandLead andThen personFirst
wayDown.get(a)
wayDown.set(a, "Jimmy")
```

???

- Ok, so that's cool. Let's make it look a little nicer.


---

# Our Third Lens

Rename `andThen` and make an infix alias for `Lens`, and add `modify`.

```tut:silent
case class Lens[A,B](set: (A, B) => A, get: A => B) {

  def >=>[C](lens: Lens[B, C]): Lens[A, C] =
    Lens((a, c) => set(a, lens.set(get(a), c)), a => lens.get(get(a)))

  def modify(a: A, f: B => B): A =
    set(a, f(get(a)))

}

type @>[A, B] = Lens[A, B]
```

---

# Our Third Lens

Define lenses on our companions objects.

```scala
case class Person(first: String, last: String)
object Person {
  val first: Person @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(first = b), _.first)
  val last:  Person @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(last  = b), _.last )
}

case class Band(name: String, lead: Person)
object Band {
  val name: Band @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
  val lead: Band @> Person = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(lead = b), _.lead)
}

case class Album(name: String, band: Band)
object Album {
  val name: Album @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
  val band: Album @> Band   = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(band = b), _.band)
}
```
```tut:invisible
// because of the repl
case class Person(first: String, last: String); object Person {
  val first: Person @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(first = b), _.first)
  val last:  Person @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(last  = b), _.last )
}

case class Band(name: String, lead: Person); object Band {
  val name: Band @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
  val lead: Band @> Person = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(lead = b), _.lead)
}

case class Album(name: String, band: Band); object Album {
  val name: Album @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
  val band: Album @> Band   = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(band = b), _.band)
}
```
---

# Our Third Lens

So now it's a little nicer to read.

```tut 
val a = Album("Lemon", Band("Pink Lloyd", Person("Steve",  "Gilmour"))) 
(Album.band >=> Band.name).set(a, "Pink Floyd")
(Album.band >=> Band.lead >=> Person.first).set(a, "David")
```

Let's try out `modify`.
```tut
(Album.band >=> Band.name).modify(a, _.toUpperCase)
```

---

# Our Fourth Lens

Observation: we can compose side-by-side, not just end-to-end.

```tut:silent
case class Lens[A,B](set: (A, B) => A, get: A => B) {

  def >=>[C](lens: Lens[B, C]): Lens[A, C] =
    Lens((a, c) => set(a, lens.set(get(a), c)), a => lens.get(get(a)))

  def modify(a: A, f: B => B): A =
    set(a, f(get(a)))

  def zip[C](lens: Lens[A, C]): Lens[A, (B, C)] =
    Lens((a, bc) => lens.set(set(a, bc._1), bc._2), a => (get(a), lens.get(a)))

}

type @>[A, B] = Lens[A, B]
```
```tut:invisible
// because of the repl
case class Person(first: String, last: String); object Person {
  val first: Person @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(first = b), _.first)
  val last:  Person @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(last  = b), _.last )
}

case class Band(name: String, lead: Person); object Band {
  val name: Band @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
  val lead: Band @> Person = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(lead = b), _.lead)
}

case class Album(name: String, band: Band); object Album {
  val name: Album @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
  val band: Album @> Band   = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(band = b), _.band)
}
val a = Album("Lemon", Band("Pink Lloyd", Person("Steve",  "Gilmour"))) 
```

---

# Our Fourth Lens

Try it!

```tut:silent
val bothNames = Person.first zip Person.last // Person @> (String, String)
val albumLeadPerson = Album.band >=> Band.lead >=> bothNames
```

Does it work?

```tut
albumLeadPerson.set(a, ("Bob", "Dole"))
```

---

# Some Generic Lenses

```tut:silent
// identity
def id[A]: A @> A = Lens((a, b) => b, a => a)

// projection
def fst[A,B]: (A, B) @> A = Lens((a, b) => (b, a._2), _._1)
def snd[A,B]: (A, B) @> B = Lens((a, b) => (a._1, b), _._2)

// a lens for set elements (!)
def includes[A](a: A): Set[A] @> Boolean =
  Lens((s, b) => if (b) s + a else s - a, _.contains(a))
```

Try it!

```tut
val nums = Set(1,2,3)
includes(4).get(nums)
includes(4).set(nums, true)
includes(2).set(nums, false)
```

???

- So rather than adding and removing from a set, we use a lens to set membership to true or false

---

# Down the Rabbit Hole

The `State` monad.

```tut:silent
case class State[S, A](run: S => (S, A)) {

  def map[B](f: A => B): State[S, B] =
    State { s =>
      val (s0, a) = run(s)
      (s0, f(a))
    }

  def flatMap[B](f: A => State[S,B]): State[S, B] =
    State { s =>
      val (s0, a) = run(s)
      f(a).run(s0)
    }

  def exec(s: S): S =
    run(s)._1

}
```

???

- I don't expect you to understand this if you haven't seen it before. It's ok to get lost here; I'm just trying to wow you a little bit.
- The idea is that we can represent a stateful computation as one that takes some starting state, uses it to compute a value *and* a new state, returning both.
- Functions of this form compose; you can define map and flatMap for them and use them in a for-comprehension.

---

# Our Fifth Lens

Observation: `Lens` operations can become `State` operations.

```tut:silent
case class Lens[A,B](set: (A, B) => A, get: A => B) { outer =>

  def >=>[C](lens: Lens[B, C]): Lens[A, C] =
    Lens((a, c) => outer.set(a, lens.set(outer.get(a), c)), a => lens.get(outer.get(a)))

  def modify(a: A, f: B => B): A =
    set(a, f(get(a)))

  def zip[C](lens: Lens[A, C]): Lens[A, (B, C)] =
    Lens((a, bc) => lens.set(set(a, bc._1), bc._2), a => (get(a), lens.get(a)))

  def :=(b: B): State[A, Unit] =
    State(a => (set(a, b), ()))

  def ask: State[A, B] =
    State(a => (a, get(a)))

}

type @>[A, B] = Lens[A, B]
```
```tut:invisible
// because of the repl
case class Person(first: String, last: String); object Person {
  val first: Person @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(first = b), _.first)
  val last:  Person @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(last  = b), _.last )
}

case class Band(name: String, lead: Person); object Band {
  val name: Band @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
  val lead: Band @> Person = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(lead = b), _.lead)
}

case class Album(name: String, band: Band); object Album {
  val name: Album @> String = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(name = b), _.name)
  val band: Album @> Band   = Lens((a, b) => a.copy(band = b), _.band)
}
val a = Album("Lemon", Band("Pink Lloyd", Person("Steve",  "Gilmour"))) 
```

---

# Our Fifth Lens

Observation: `Lens` operations can become `State` operations.

```tut:silent
val albumName = Album.name
val bandName  = Album.band >=> Band.name
val leadFirst = Album.band >=> Band.lead >=> Person.first

def update =
  for {
    _ <- albumName := "Dark Side of the Moon"
    _ <- bandName  := "Pink Floyd"
    n <- leadFirst.ask
    _ <- leadFirst := "*" * n.length
  } yield ()
```

Umm, ok?

```tut
update.exec(a)
```

???

- So now what we have is an imperative program that's totally functional. You write it as if you were mutating something but instead it's a pure operation. Which is cool.
